    <h1>[FreeCodeCamp] Front End Development Libraries Projects</h1>
    <h2>Build a Random Quote Machine</h2>
    <p align="justify">
      Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to this: <a href="https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/qRZeGZ">https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/qRZeGZ</a>.</p>
    <p align="justify">Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests
      to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own
      personal style.</p>
    <p align="justify">You can use any mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap,
      SASS, React, Redux, and jQuery to complete this project. You should use a
      frontend framework (like React for example) because this section is about
      learning frontend frameworks. Additional technologies not listed above are
      not recommended and using them is at your own risk. We are looking at
      supporting other frontend frameworks like Angular and Vue, but they are
      not currently supported. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports
      that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!</p>

      I can see an element with a corresponding <strong>id="author"</strong>.</p>
    <p align="justify"><strong>User Story #4</strong>: Within <strong>#quote-box</strong>,
      I can see a clickable element with a corresponding <strong>id="new-quote"</strong>.</p>
    <p align="justify"><strong>User Story #5</strong>: Within <strong>#quote-box</strong>,
      I can see a clickable <strong>a</strong> element with a corresponding <strong>id="tweet-quote"</strong>.</p>
    <p align="justify"><strong>User Story #6</strong>: On first load, my quote
      machine displays a random quote in the element with <strong>id="text"</strong>.</p>
    <p align="justify"><strong>User Story #7</strong>: On first load, my quote
      machine displays the random quote's author in the element with <strong>id="author"</strong>.</p>
    <p align="justify"><strong>User Story #8</strong>: When the <strong>#new-quote</strong>
      button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display
      it in the <strong>#text</strong> element.</p>
    <p align="justify"><strong>User Story #9</strong>: My quote machine should
      fetch the new quote's author when the <strong>#new-quote</strong> button
      is clicked and display it in the <strong>#author</strong> element.</p>
    <p align="justify"><strong>User Story #10</strong>: I can tweet the current
      quote by clicking on the <strong>#tweet-quote</strong> a element. This <strong>a</strong>
      element should include the <strong>"twitter.com/intent/tweet"</strong>
      path in its <strong>href </strong>attribute to tweet the current quote.</p>
    <p align="justify"><strong>User Story #11</strong>: The <strong>#quote-box</strong>
      wrapper element should be horizontally centered. Please run tests with
      browser's zoom level at 100% and page maximized.</p>
    <p align="justify">You can build your project by using this CodePen template
      and clicking <strong>Save </strong>to create your own pen. Or you can
      use this CDN link to run the tests in any environment you like: <a href="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js">https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js</a></p>
    <p align="justify">Once you're done, submit the URL to your working project
      with all its tests passing.</p>
    <p>Note: Twitter does not allow links to be loaded in an iframe. Try using
      the <strong>target="_blank"</strong> or <strong>target="_top" </strong>attribute
      on the <strong>#tweet-quote</strong> element if your tweet won't load. <strong>target="_top"</strong>
      will replace the current tab so make sure your work is saved.</p>
